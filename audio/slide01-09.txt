Apis mellifera scutellata, the East African lowland honeybee, is a subspecies of the western honey bee which has been determined to constitute one part of the ancestry of the Africanized bees spreading through America. There is no record of Apis mellifera scutellata on Guam and there is no evidence of Africanization of domestic or feral populations of Apis mellifera on Guam.
