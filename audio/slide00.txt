In March of this year, Diagne et al. published an article in Nature which included a list of the top 10 of the world's most costly invasive species. By my count 5 of these have been reported from Guam. I was curious to see how this invasive species load compared with that of other places.

I originally intended to compare Guam with the rest of the world, but decided to limit my analysis to other Pacific islands. Thus the small change in my title.
