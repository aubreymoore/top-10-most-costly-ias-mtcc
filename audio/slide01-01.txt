Aedes is a genus of mosquitoes. Members of this genus are vectors of arboviruses which include dengue, zika, West Nile and many others. Guam has 4 species of Aedes: albopictus, hensilli, pandani and guamensis. Aedes aegypti was previously present, but this is one of the very few invasive species successfully eradicated from the island.
